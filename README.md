- 👋 Hi, I’m @kimhegedus
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about the backend of development to assist with running my small business.  My background is in program and project management, but I want to learn more about coding and new technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of Git and GitHub as well as Svelte for the small business my husband and I run.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner level Svelte web apps to assist me with building out our website.  I'm very new to this, but ready to learn!
- 📫 Reach out to me at kim@22ndtech.com
